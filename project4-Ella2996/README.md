# Project 4: A Hash Table
For this project, you will implement a Map ADT using a hash table using three different collision resolution techniques:
- Open hashing with separate chaining
- Closed hashing with linear probing
- Closed hashing with double hashing


Please refer to the pdf project description on Canvas.
