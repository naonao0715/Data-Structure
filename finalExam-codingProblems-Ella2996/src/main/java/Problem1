(a) The running time for the first two for loop is O(n^2) (1 + 2 + .... n). And the third
for loop running time is O(logn). So overall, it's O(n^2 logn)

(b) Bubble sort
O(n^2)

For the first two for loop it's O(n^2) (1 + 2 + ... n - 1). Also there is a print method
which is O(n). So in total it's O(n^2 + n^2) = O(n^2)
